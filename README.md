> “This is the real secret of life -- to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.”

### Goal	
Alan Watts' synthesized voice over an autogenerated text sample about the state of the modern world.

### Data/Labels
Alan Watts' lectures, essays, and books.

### Phase I - Voice Synthesis
1. Download training data for both voice and text
2. Set up dataset structure
    - original recordings
    - wavs, mp3
    - transcripts
    - mel spectograms
    - matadata.csv
3. Split recordings into audio clips
4. Auto transcribe clips
5. Create metadata files
6. Train Tacotron 2
7. Train Waveglow
8. Evaluate

### Phase II - Text Generation
1. Download training data for both voice and text
2. Transcribe existing audio / video files
3. Trim and combine
4. Create a RNN (?)
5. Evaluate
