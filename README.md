# What would Alan Watts say if he were here with us today?

### Idea	
Generate an essay leveraging Alan Watts' writing style and synthesized voiceover. Create a philosobot for live Q & A. 

### Data/Labels
Alan Watts lectures posted on Youtube and Spotify. Essays and books found on the internet. Will need to architect a good RNN and properly tune hyperparameters.	

### Final Solution
Synthesized voice over an autogenerated text sample about the state of the modern world posted on YouTube, followed by a Philosobot for live interaction. Whole project covered in a Medium article and shared on LinkedIn. Open repository to share.
